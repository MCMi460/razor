> *"A simple music player that takes your favorite songs from YouTube and lets you play them on your PC!"*

Razor is exactly what it sounds like â€“ but *better*. It downloads songs from YouTube and saves them offline in an easy-to-use application for personal listening!

**But how do I use it?**  
Here's the thing: We don't even have to tell you. Just download the [windows.zip or mac.zip](https://github.com/MCMi460/razor/releases/latest) onto your computer and run! It's as simple as that!

If you'd like to chat more about Razor, suggest new features, point out bugs, or get support, you can join [our Discord server here](https://discord.gg/KxUEqFRvwF).
