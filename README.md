# Razor

> *"A simple music player that takes your favorite songs from YouTube and lets you play them on your PC!"*

Razor is exactly what it sounds like â€“ but *better*. It downloads songs from YouTube and saves them offline in an easy-to-use application for personal listening!

**But how do I use it?**  
Here's the thing: We don't even have to tell you. Just download the [`.exe` (Windows) or `.app` (Mac)](https://github.com/MCMi460/razor/releases/latest) onto your computer and run! It's as simple as that!
